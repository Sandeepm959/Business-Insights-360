# Business-Insights-360
## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware has been growing rapidly in recent years, and they have decided to implement data analytics using PowerBi in their company for the first time to surpass their competitors in the market and to make data-driven decisions. This project is hoped to give answers to the questions of stakeholders in terms all aspects like finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics PowerBi Course, Link to the course is [here](https://codebasics.io/courses/power-bi-data-analysis-with-end-to-end-project)

## Companyâ€™s background

AltiQ Hardware is a company that has grown vastly in recent years, and opened business all over the globe. It is a company that sells computers and computer accessories through three mediums/channel

- Retailers
- Direct
- Distributors

Recently, the company faced an unforeseen loss by opening a store in America based on surveys, intuition, and some Excel analysis. Also, the companyâ€™s competitors have a handful of analytics teams to perform analysis and make data-driven decisions. So, AltiQ Hardware has no other option than building its analytics team for data-driven insights and decisions in the future to survive better in the industry. 

Project kick-off session, where you should get clear of what and why this project is and all other questions you have with regards to the project

### Questions to ask before starting with the dashboard

- What is the objective of building this PowerBi dashboard?
- In what terms will the success of this project be measured?
- What will be the deadline of the project?
- Are the stakeholders expecting a preview before the actual release?
- What are all the hopes stakeholders have out of this project?
- what are all the fears the stakeholders have in terms of building this dashboard?
- Who will be using this dashboard and for what purpose?
- what are all expectations the stakeholders have, by the completion of this project?
- What can go wrong while building this project?
- what are all the resources/ data needed to build this dashboard?
- Is there any input from stakeholders in terms of design and views of the dashboard?

After the project kick-off meetings, the data engineering team has given the data as per the request of the data analytics team, letâ€™s explore them.

### Dataset **Understanding.**

Understanding what data is available will be more helpful while doing analysis. before jumping on to the analysis get a good understanding of what are data available.

Dimension table: It will have static data like details of customers and products

Fact table: It will have the data about the transactions  

- gdb041:
    - dim_customer

        - This table is used to forecast the customerâ€™s needs in advance, which can help in
            - Higher customer satisfaction
            - Reduced cost in warehouses for storage purposes
        - The table is denormalized by the data engineering team, as it is a data warehouse which is aimed to be used for analytical work.
        - All the dates of the month will be replaced by the start date of the month
        - It will have all the column names and in the end, it will have the forecast quantity needed of the customer
    - fact_sales_monthly

    - Post_invoice_deductions
        - Post invoice deductions and other deduction details

## Importing data into PowerBi

- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modeling is a must. Refer to this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- In this project, we have followed the Snowfall data modeling method.
